arrays are like what python calls a list, but they all have to be the same type (homogeneous) including collections
    array forces you to state the type

a list is like an array with some different extra functions 
    I wonder how python sorts a list of numbers and characters

array doesn't interact with print, so print is telling me the thing it can't print.
    How would I print the data out of an array?

I found the `type` function in the docs, it allows me to check the type of collection is used in case I write it wrong, as I was figuring
out the homework, before I learned I have to import the array module I had accidentally made another list, then also a tuple.
    I find it interesting that if array is imported as arr, print(type(x)) still shows it as array.array
        array doesn't ineract with print, so print is telling me the thing it can't print.
            how can I print a list?

I imported Array as arr was that made it easier for me to use what you wrote as a reference point, later on my own I think I will import
modules as primatives using `from x import x`

I need to remember to print my data so I can visibly see the result in the terminal
    Can I sort an array? How do I sort an array?

anything inside single quotes is a character
anything in double quotes is a string

an array is a modifier of a list

from array import array - imports as primitive, you have to use array()
import array - imports array as a module, you have to use array.x()
import array as arr - imports array as a module named arr, you have to ue arr.x()
