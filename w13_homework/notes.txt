HOMEWORK
euclidian distance(pythagorean theorem)
write a function to compute the distance between two cartesianal points (do the pythagorean theorem)

create two points on a graph and find the distance between the two points | absolute value
only need a function that executes the pythagorean theorem on two cartesian points 

extra credit if function only uses 2 inputs
extra credit to make it work in all 4 quadrants
