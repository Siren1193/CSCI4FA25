x-y =/= y-x
def f(x,y,z):      z defines the operator

python math module has a hypotnuse funtion which I can use for this assignment
math.hypot(x,y)
For a two dimensional point (x, y), this is equivalent to computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, sqrt(x*x + y*y).

if I can turn the list of coordinates into a singular integer, I can then use math.hypot between the two points
