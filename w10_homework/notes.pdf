if a stack is first in, last out, theoretically if we pop the tail instead of the head, this should work.
    what if we just used the queue as it is, but we define the head as the same point as the tail?
        in order to turn a pop the tail of our list so it functions as a stack, we need our function to access the list named stack,
        and then pop what we defined as the tail of our list which is the length - 1
