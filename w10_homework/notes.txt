homework: build a stack in python
in theory, we can easily convert the queue file into a stack by swapping something

if a stack is first in, last out, theoretically if we pop the tail instead of the head, this should work
what if we just used the queue as it is, but we define the head as the same point as the tail?



queue: first in, first out
stack: first in, last out

push puts some new element into the queue. 

common verbage is to push something into a queue when adding to a queue
common verbage is to pop something off of a queue when removing something from a queue
