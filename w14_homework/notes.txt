x-y =/= y-x

| x1 - x2 |^2 + |y1 - x2 |^2 = c^2

    let x1,y1 and x2,y2 be constants

python math module has a hypotnuse funtion which I can use for this assignment
math.hypot(x,y)
"For a two dimensional point (x, y), this is equivalent to computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, sqrt(x*x + y*y)."

if I can turn the list of coordinates into a singular integer, I can then use math.hypot between the two points

if I get the difference between the distance of the x coordinates as a value, and the difference of the y values I can then run that through math.hypot

for this assignment I can't use libraries. instead I should:
    create a list with 2 points (our x and y values)
    d_2 = abs(x1 - x2) ** 2 + abs(y1 - y2) ** 2
    d = abs(d_2** (1/2))

I could in theory just do the math that the hypot function does written out rather than using the function to shortcut
