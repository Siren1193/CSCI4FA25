#python code

# f : Num -> Num
def f(x): # define the function using "def" <name>(<input list>)
        return (x + 1) # must return some value
print(f(1.5))
print(f(2), f(4), f(6))

#homework due tuesday: create 3 different functions on paper, write their types, define what they do (give them input and output arrays)
