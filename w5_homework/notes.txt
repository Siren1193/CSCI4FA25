Can I turn a list into an int?
    What I want to do is plug the list into a function and get a list of results
    print(f(1),f(2),f(3),f(4),f(5),etc) works for now, but this is not a great long term solution, expecially if I don't know each input
        I might be able to add outputs of functions to a list, then plug each postition of the list into the input
            INPUT ARRAY

how do I do exponents inside of a return function?

if I want to use parenthesis within a math equation, I can't write that since python uses parenthesis to call functions, so how would I create seperate terms within an expression?
    I can create a binding to work as a "variable" in the equation and then use the integer of that binding in the expression
        def f(x):
            b = (z + y)
            b = int(b)
        return((x * b) / N)
    I dont like how this includes the first decimal value because it looks different than every other printed output from my functions, also in the real world case I use this function there can never be a decimal value so why display it at all 
        I'm going to find a way to get rid of or at least hide the decimal value from the terminal
            I imported the math module solely to use the truncate function math.trunc() to hide the decimal value
